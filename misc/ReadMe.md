# Standalone FrontEnd Project

This is a Standalone FrontEnd Project Scaffolding. This provides as a starting point to start FrontEnd Development - completely decoupled from the Backend Technology

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Visual Studio 2015 or Any decent IDE like Sublime Text, Brackets, Atom
* [Web Essentials for Visual Studio 2015](http://vswebessentials.com/download) - This plugin is required to compile, minify and bundling of JS, SASS files (only for Visual Studio IDE )
* [Web Extension Pack 2015 ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebExtensionPack) - This plugin is required to compile, minify and bundling of JS, SASS files (only for Visual Studio IDE )
* For Sublime Text, Brackets and Atom IDE - the user will have to install [node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Write a Gulp Automate Script - [Gulp for Beginners](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/)



### CSS - Preprocessor 

At The Earthworks we use SASS ( file extension .scss) as our preferred choice of CSS preprocessor. To use it with Visual Studio and Web Essentials you won't need to install SASS on your local development machine. However if you are using IDE such as sublime Text or Atom you will have to install SASS on your local machine.[Sass installation](http://sass-lang.com/install)

### JS 
At The Earthworks we use jQuery as a third party library for our projects. We follow Object Oriented approach in structuring all the JS files 


## Deployment
At The Earthworks we have 3 Development Environments : Development, Staging, Production.
We have a Continuous Integration (CI) configured with TeamCity and Octopus which enables us to deploy the project or a feature of the project to Development Environments. All the code is source controlled using GIT with BitBucket Repositories.
